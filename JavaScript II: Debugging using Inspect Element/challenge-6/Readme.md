# Challenge 6: Dynamic Task Manager
## Problem Statement
Create a Task Manager web app that helps users organize their daily activities. Users should be able to add tasks, update their status (Pending or Completed), delete tasks, filter them by status, and sort them by priority (in ascending or descending order).

Note: Use Inspect Element in your browser to understand how your code is operating.

### Your Task
In HTML, create an area where users can add new tasks. It should include:
A text input where users can enter the task name.
A dropdown to select task priority — High, Medium, or Low.
An Add Task button to add the task to the list.
In HTML, below the input section, create controls for managing existing tasks:
A dropdown to filter tasks by status — All, Pending, or Completed.
A Sort by Priority button to toggle sorting order (ascending or descending).
A container to display the task list.
Implement JavaScript logic to:
Add a new task showing its name, priority, and default status (Pending).
Allow each task to have two buttons:
One to toggle its status between Pending and Completed.
Another to delete the task.
Filter tasks based on the selected status.
Sort tasks by priority each time the Sort button is clicked, alternating between ascending and descending.
Think Before You Code
Before writing any code, take time to plan your solution in depth. Break the requirements into smaller steps — decide what needs to happen first, what follows, and how each part will connect. Once you have your plan, start implementing each step one by one.
